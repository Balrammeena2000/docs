# What is Nutbox

Nutbox is a DAO operating system for Web3.0, as well as a diversified project combining "social + Finance". With the help of the Crowd-Staking, DAO Services and Plugins and DAO Governance Protocol provided by Nutbox, the community can create its own community staking module and DAO platform just like creating trading pairs on Uniswap. At the same time, Nutbox contains content, NFT, and other components that the community can easily deploy to their own DAO. The road map of Nutbox can be divided into 3 development phases, namely Peanut (Nutbox v1), Walnut (Nutbox v2), Donut (Nutbox v3) respectively.
