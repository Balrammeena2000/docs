# PNUT

## Staking reward

In the PoW consensus mechanism, miners "lock" energy and hardware assets to obtain network rewards. Similarly, in order to obtain rewards for protecting network security (staking rewards), validators of the PoS chain need to lock the original assets of the PoS chain (Staking Token).

Taking the Steem blockchain as an example, users will power up circulated STEEM into STEEM POWER (SP), vote for high-quality posts or vote witnesses, and receive staking rewards. The user's own operation is complicated and has many obstacles, and it is necessary to pay a service fee of about 20% when handing it over to the traditional delegation platform.  

## Delegate SP gets PNUT

Peanut provides a solution: through nutbox.io, SP will be delegated to Peanut (@nutbox.mine), that is, PNUT can be continuously rewarded.

Peanut (@nutbox.mine) will use the SP that users delegated to obtain curator rewards (curator rewards, which can be regarded as staking rewards) through a series of strategies, and then use curator rewards to repurchase PNUT on the open market.
