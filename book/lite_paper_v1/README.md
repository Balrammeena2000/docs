# Introduction

Peanut is a community staking platform based on the PoS consensus mechanism (including DPoS, NPoS, etc.) blockchain.

Peanut is committed to providing staking token holders with easier access to staking rewards (Staking reward), helping users to circulate liquidity staking tokens with restricted circulation (Liquidity Staking Token), and satisfying the cross-cutting of original assets (Tokens) in the PoS chain. Chain transaction needs, as well as the financial management (fixed deposit or current) needs of Token holders.

The first phase of Peanut is built on the Tron blockchain to serve users who hold Steem assets. The second phase will be extended to Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum, and will eventually be built on Polkadot to serve all PoS chain assets connected to Polkadot.
