# Peanut governance

Peanut DAO was established to support the long-term development of Peanut and Nutbox, and its funding comes from the 10% PNUT that enters the DAO.

## Governance process

Peanut DAO makes the project ultimately managed by its community, with contributors initiating proposals, discussing on the community media, and being voted by community members. All proposals need to be voted by the community to be binding. Peanut DAO gives the community the ability to reward some non-standard contributions. The proposal and voting process is as follows:
 
* Community contributors submit proposals;
* The community fully discussed the proposal;
* Participate in on-chain governance and use PNUT POWER for measurement;
* DAO Fund automatically distributes PNUT to the approved proposals.

## Requirement

The governance process starts with submitting a proposal, and the community can discuss the proposal. Any individual or organization that meets the requirements can submit a proposal. Holders of PNUT POWER can vote on the proposal after full discussion.

To submit a proposal, the user must transfer 1000 PNUT to Peanut.dao. The pre-reviewed proposal will return 1000 PNUT in the same way. The transfer amount of the proposal that does not meet the basic requirements will not be refunded.

PNUT POWER can be set according to the situation:

* Each staked PNUT is equivalent to 1 PNUT POWER;
* Each PNUT in PNUT-TRX, PNUT-ETH pool or PNUT-DOT pool is equivalent to 4 PNUT POWER;
* other indicators determined by communities.

Proposals need to reach the "minimum legal acceptance ratio"-(yes-negative) / have the qualifications of the proposal> 30%.

## DAO Committee

Since Peanut is a decentralized community governance, in order to adapt to the changing environment and support continuous contributors, the DAO committee handles daily affairs. Before the release of early cross-chain staking and other agreements, the DAO committee made decisions on behalf of the community, and major decisions must be approved by the community in the form of proposal voting.

The DAO committee is voted by PNUT POWER holders. Once the members of the committee are elected, they will serve for six months and are subject to community supervision. Peanut pays full-time contributors through contributor governance contracts, and no less than 20% of its Chinese library is awarded to the DAO committee by PNUT to encourage them to continue to contribute to the community.
