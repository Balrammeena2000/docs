# Cross-chain bridge

STEEM is a Steem blockchain asset. If you want to trade into other cryptocurrencies, you can only trade on a centralized exchange. The cross-chain bridge provides a possibility for STEEM to transfer to other blockchains through the cross-chain bridge, such as Ethereum, Tron, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, etc.

The assets after cross-chain transfer (called TSTEEM) can be traded into USDT, ETH, WBTC through Uniswap on Ethereum, USDT and TRX through JustSwap on Tron, and USDT, BNB, etc. through Pancake on Binance Smart Chain. 

Peanut provides one-click transfer of STEEM into Tron-based equivalent assets tSTEEM (TRC20), which can be traded into USDT, TRX, PNUT, etc. through JustSwap.Â
