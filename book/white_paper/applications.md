# Applications

In general, there are three types of DAOs on Nutbox. The first category is a decentralized autonomous community. DAO provides a more powerful distributed management method for the community, allowing community users to collaborate around DAO. This includes most blockchain systems, DeFi communities, and communities around DApps. The second category is a decentralized autonomous company, a form of organization that combines a company with a DAO. Many companies will transition to this organizational form, and there are currently a large number of companies trying to build communities on top of the company. Finally, there is a DAO centered around social relationships and social capital with individuals as the core circle. The fan economy is filled with a lot of "Social Token + DAO" examples.

## Decentralized autonomous community

DAO first spread in the blockchain world. Since the birth of the Bitcoin system as the first large-scale application of DAO, most of the past blockchain systems, DeFi communities, and DApps can be included in the category of decentralized autonomous communities.

### Decentralized Staking Provider

The Proof of Stake mechanism has spawned a large number of Staking Providers, which occupy a market of 146 billion U.S. dollars. 8000+ organizations provide staking services for users who hold encrypted assets.

The Crowd-staking Protocol and other protocols provided by Nutbox enable community users of the PoS chain to gather into DAOs, use the services provided by the staking mining pool controlled by DAOs, and replace centralized staking with decentralized staking. The relationship between the two is similar to Dex and Cex. 

### DeFi platform for other blockchains

We know that various DeFi services first appeared in Ethereum, and then spread to blockchains such as Tron, Binance Smart Chain, and Heco. These chains all satisfy two essential factors: the underlying digital assets and the blockchain that supports smart contracts.

Nutbox's related agreements are built on the blockchain that supports smart contracts, and through the cross-chain agreement, the digital assets of the blockchain that have not yet superimposed DeFi services are cross-chained into the Nutbox protocol. In this way, any community on the blockchain can use the protocols and tools provided by Nutbox to create DeFi services for its blockchain.

Peanut is an example of this. It is the first DeFi DAO for PoS chains created by Nutbox. Steem Blockchain lacks smart contracts, Nutbox built a DeFi protocol on the Tron blockchain for Peanut. Through the cross-chain bridge provided by Nutbox, Steem Blockchain local asset holders can enjoy various DeFi services in Peanut.

### Staking + DeFi

Staking Liquidity Protocol has produced a new type of asset-tToken, which has some new features: stake and staking reward.

As the staking certificate of Token, tToken makes the transaction and lending between the two greatly different from traditional DeFi. tToken integrates staking reward, which will make tToken pool a revenue aggregator different from YFI. If the tToken pool participates in Crowd-staking to obtain cToken, this aggregator acts as a vc fund. If the tToken pool participates in the staking voting of the PoS chain to obtain the PoS local Token, the aggregator can be regarded as a PoS chain mining pool. In short, tToken opens a new form of DeFi, which we call "Staking+DeFi". 

### DAO based on traditional communities

#### Online interest community

The Internet allows ordinary people to be online, and online individuals gather in every corner to form a community with the nature of DAO. Broadly speaking, we can regard every Douban group, game guild, and online interest community as the prototype of a DAO, and the blockchain has the potential to become a real DAO. In particular, some vertical platforms were born from interest groups, such as Mafengwo from travel enthusiasts sharing strategies together, and Zhihu from a group of knowledge sharing enthusiasts.

Like-minded fans gather into a community and condense into a DAO through a series of agreements to solve the problems of a specific community and generate certain social value. Such a DAO is taking shape. Through the mechanism of crowdfunding creation and publishing, mirror.xyz has helped high-quality creators publish works and made a great attempt. Can the guild in the game and the team in Douban cooperate with each other under a specific mechanism to form a DAO with a certain effect? This is worth looking forward to, and it is also the key area of Metaverst's test.

#### Offline interest community

Like people gathering online, the Internet makes it easier for people in a city or community to gather offline. Like-minded people gather in different communities, regularly launch offline activities every week, and rely on a distributed form of organization. WorkFace and Aisi Youth are such representatives.

However, what is regrettable is that it will take a year for Aisi Youth to end this community that has existed for more than 10 years, and the partners of WorkFace have almost worked for the organization for nearly ten years. As an organization, the community does not need to receive financial rewards, but the small partners who contribute to it need to get appropriate remuneration in order to maintain their lives. In the city of Chengdu alone, WorkFace has served more than 100,000 young people and held more than 260 events in a decentralized manner. Using the protocols and tools provided by Nutbox, WorkFace members can participate in community activities in DApp, participate in community building and social interaction, and WorkFace DAO can become a sustainable organization.

Luhu, which uses the community as a test field, is also exploring the governance of the future Luhu community through decentralized autonomy. Luhu has established a community foundation, a community federation, and a Luhu council, initiated 40+ communities in the community, developed Ludingji bbs, and the community initiated a variety of offline activities. The combination of Luhu and Nutbox's Protocol Factory will bring a different DAO.

## Decentralized Autonomous Corporations

Blockchain is naturally capable of forming DACs. Daniel Larimer started Bitshares from the exploration of Decentralized Autonomous Corporations. Vitalik also explored DACs before founding Ethereum.

Traditional companies are no exception. With the development of communities, companies are exploring the combination of communities and companies into a more efficient organization. The combination of decentralized autonomous organizations and companies may be able to effectively make up for the shortcomings of all parties and give full play to their respective advantages. 

## Social Token + DAO

Social tokens are DAOs with individuals or groups at the core. It is a quantification of social capital. Individuals or groups can manage and invest in social capital by issuing social tokens. For DAOs with a fan or community basis, social tokens are conducive to better economic activities such as personal financing, membership, fan economy, and subscription.

Social tokens have created a production network with individuals as the main body. The issuer of the social token acts as a minimal DAO, and the investors of the social token participate in the construction of the DAO, which actually creates a form of community participation to minimize DAO collaboration. The combination of social tokens and popular NFTs will build an effective content production network and better activate the vitality of individuals and communities.
