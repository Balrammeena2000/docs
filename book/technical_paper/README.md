# Introduction

For a long time, whether in traditional communities or blockchain communities, community operators have been distressed about how to make the community active. Initially due to the rise of the blockchain token economy, the community will choose to issue its own community tokens to incentivize users participating in the community, and promote the community to have a higher degree of activity and value capture driven by the community tokens. For example, a community running a sharing application issues its own tokens, which can be earned by both sharing and renting items. In this way, community members receive additional financial incentives when using the product.

For now, however, it is not enough for the community to simply issue its own tokens. After the community issues its own tokens, it can play a role in stimulating community activity and increasing community value in the short term. But in the long run, community tokens often fail to bring substantial changes to the community due to the lack of a complete price support system or the lack of a good internal circulation of the economy. Therefore, enabling community tokens to truly circulate in the community has become a problem that the industry urgently needs to solve.

The popularity of the PoS consensus algorithm [1] provides us with a new set of solutions. The PoS consensus algorithm is used to solve the problems of low TPS and poor system scalability under the original PoW consensus algorithm [2] of the blockchain network. Unlike the PoW consensus algorithm, which enables anyone who provides hardware device can access the blockchain network to become a validator, in a blockchain network based on the PoS consensus algorithm, users need to stake a certain amount of network assets, and then become a validator to obtain rewards by verifying the block. When you exit as a validator, you can still get back your staked assets. Under the PoS consensus system, nodes participating in the network no longer need to compete in hardware, which consumes a lot of power resources. This economic model that stakes the original assets of the blockchain network and obtains income on this basis has a good economic closed loop and can make the blockchain network operate stably for a long time under a healthy economic cycle.

Unfortunately, this economic model is currently only used in the consensus system of the blockchain network itself. It does not bring direct value to the applications, that is, the communities running in the blockchain network.
What Nutbox is trying to do is to build an open asset staking protocol that allows the blockchain community to build an economic model of the staking for its community assets in a blockchain network based on the POS consensus algorithm.
